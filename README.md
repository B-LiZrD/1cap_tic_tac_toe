First Capstone Project

String manipulation, nested lists, and list manipulation functions with multiple parameters that take more than one argument as well as type conversions. The user inputs a number that corresponds with a square in order to make their move. Also, the computer is random with its moves (not logical).

The condition that was given to me was that the computer always goes first and it always picks the middle square when it does.
